This repo demonstrates how updates to a ConfigMaps are reflected
within a pod.

Assuming your ~/.kube/config points to a working k8s cluster:

* Edit Makefile and update the registry mentioned in the IMAGE
  variable.  Use a registry that you can push to and which your k8s
  cluster can pull from.

* Run 'make'.  This will build a container image for a program which
  watches for and reports changes to a file.  The image is tagged and
  pushed to a registry.  Then Deployment and ConfigMap resources are
  created.

* Examine the logs for the configmap-test pod.

* Update the configmap by editing manifests/configmap.yaml and editing
  the text for the config.txt entry.  Save and run 'make' again.

* Monitor the logs for the configmap-test pod and eventually you will
  see that it notices the updated file from the configmap.
